# Toss Buildings

Pretty simple idea: Engi can now throw his buildings while carrying them.
To throw buildings, press your Reload key. They will construct while in air, bounce off walls and finally be usable at the desitnation.
You can't throw during Waiting For Players, If a building lands in a spawn room or sticks into other things, it will blow up.

Credits to zen for the idea :)

## Dependencies
* VPhysics Extension - because it's the best way to accelerate physics props
* TF2Utils - because that can check if things are in spawn rooms
* SMLib Transitional-Syntax - because it makes things easier for me (*COMPILE ONLY*)
